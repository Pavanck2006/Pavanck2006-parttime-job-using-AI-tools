# PartTime Job Platform

> **"Find Work. Earn More. Work Safely."**

A production-grade full-stack job marketplace connecting college students with catering businesses and event organizers needing temporary staff — food servers, kitchen assistants, cleaners, and event helpers across Bangalore.

---

## Features

### Core Platform
- **Three-Role System** — Student, Owner (catering business), and Admin with JWT authentication and bcrypt password hashing
- **Job Discovery & Application** — Public job browsing with filters (area, work type, date, payment range), plus per-job application with notes
- **Location Privacy** — General work areas shown publicly; exact venue addresses and organizer contacts unlock only after acceptance
- **On-Spot Payment Workflow** — Owners mark shifts as paid, students confirm receipt; built-in dispute resolution with six complaint types
- **Worker Slot Limits** — Strict capacity enforcement prevents over-hiring; automatic `FILLED` status when full
- **Owner Verification** — Admin-granted verified badges; safety advisory notices shown for unverified organizers

### Communication & Safety
- **In-App Notifications** — Real-time alerts for application status changes, payment updates, and system events
- **Complaint Chat** — Dedicated messaging thread between complainant and target user per dispute
- **Audit Logging** — Full trail of all critical platform actions
- **Email OTP Verification** — 6-digit code sent via SMTP during registration and password reset

### Admin Dashboard
- Platform-wide metrics (total users, jobs, open disputes, active listings)
- User management with suspend/reactivate controls
- Owner verification grant/revoke
- Job moderation and removal
- Dispute resolution with formal admin remarks

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or later — [Download](https://nodejs.org)
- **MySQL** 8+ — [Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) or use XAMPP / Docker

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd parttime-job-platform-node
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=parttimejob_db
JWT_SECRET=some-random-secret-string
PORT=8080

# Email OTP (optional — required for registration)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=you@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
SMTP_FROM="PartTime Job <you@gmail.com>"
```

> If SMTP is not configured, the OTP step will return a 503 error. For local testing, use the pre-seeded accounts below.

### 3. Start the server

```bash
npm start          # production
npm run dev        # development with --watch auto-reload
```

The server will:
1. Create the `parttimejob_db` database if it doesn't exist
2. Run all DDL from `schema.sql`
3. Seed demo accounts and sample jobs from `data.sql`
4. Listen on `http://localhost:8080`

### 4. Open in browser

Navigate to **http://localhost:8080**

## Demo Accounts

Pre-seeded and ready for immediate login:

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| **Admin** | `admin@parttimejob.com` | `Admin@123` |
| **Owner** (verified) | `owner.srilakshmi@catering.com` | `Owner@123` |
| **Owner** (pending) | `owner.royal@catering.com` | `Owner@123` |
| **Student** | `student.pavan@gmail.com` | `Student@123` |
| **Student** | `student.ananya@gmail.com` | `Student@123` |

The login dialog includes quick-fill buttons for one-click testing.
